# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really only have one project that I have in mind to work on for the 100 Days of Code challenge. I will work on this until
it's complete. After that I will have to find something else to work on.

**Link to work:** NA
